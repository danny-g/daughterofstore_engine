## Daughter of StoreEngine


### What's this all about? 

DOSE is a mix between Shopify and Ebay. Users are able to create and manage their stores through an admin interface 
similar to an ecommerce platform like Shopify and create auctions for their products similar to Ebay. 
Store owners can end auctions at their discretion and view orders for won products to be shipped.
